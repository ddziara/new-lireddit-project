    const isItInTheCache = cache.resolve(entityKey, fieldName, fieldArgs); 
    info.partial = !!isItInTheCache; // indicates that some data is uncached


# next there's a problem with backend data - the same "createdAt"
# hence we create a new migrations overriding the other one

npx typeorm migration:create ./src/migrations/FakePosts

# we again generate data at https://mockaroo.com/
# with fields:
# tittle         "Movie Title"
# text           "Paragraphs"    1-3
# "creatorId"    "Custom List"   [5]
# "createdAt"    "Datetime"      ISO 8601 (UTC)
