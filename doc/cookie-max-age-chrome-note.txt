Cookie property: Max-Age

As of Chrome release M104 (August 2022) cookies can no longer set an expiration 
date more than 400 days in the future. This change does not impact session cookies—cookies 
that do not explicitly set an expiration date with Max-Age or Expires —as these are instead 
cleared when the browsing session ends.

Note: The same behaviour in Microsoft Edge
