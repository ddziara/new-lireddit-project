app.set(name, value)

Assigns setting name to value. You may store any value that you want, 
but certain names can be used to configure the behavior of the server.

"trust proxy"         Indicates the app is behind a front-facing proxy, and to use the X-Forwarded-* headers 
                      to determine the connection and the IP address of the client. NOTE: X-Forwarded-* headers 
                      are easily spoofed and the detected IP addresses are unreliable.

                      When enabled, Express attempts to determine the IP address of the client connected through 
                      the front-facing proxy, or series of proxies. The `req.ips` property, then contains an array 
                      of IP addresses the client is connected through. To enable it, use the values described in 
                      the trust proxy options table.

                      The `trust proxy` setting is implemented using the proxy-addr package. For more information, 
                      see its documentation.

                      NOTE: Sub-apps will inherit the value of this setting, even though it has a default value.

"trust proxy" may be 

Boolean               If true, the client’s IP address is understood as the left-most entry in the X-Forwarded-For header.
                      If false, the app is understood as directly facing the client and the client’s IP address is derived from
                      req.socket.remoteAddress. This is the default setting.

                      -----------------------------------------------------------------
                      When setting to true, it is important to ensure that the last reverse proxy trusted is 
                      removing/overwriting all of the following HTTP headers: X-Forwarded-For, X-Forwarded-Host, 
                      and X-Forwarded-Proto otherwise it may be possible for the client to provide any value.
                      -----------------------------------------------------------------

IP addresses          An IP address, subnet, or an array of IP addresses and subnets to trust as being a reverse proxy. 
                      The following list shows the pre-configured subnet names:

                        * loopback - 127.0.0.1/8, ::1/128
                        * linklocal - 169.254.0.07/16, fe80::/10
                        * uniquelocal - 10.0.0.0/8, 172.16.0.0/12, 192.168.0.0/16, fc00::/7
                       
                      You can set IP addresses in any of the following ways:

                        app.set('trust proxy', 'loopback') // specify a single subnet
                        app.set('trust proxy', 'loopback, 123.123.123.123') // specify a subnet and an address
                        app.set('trust proxy', 'loopback, linklocal, uniquelocal') // specify multiple subnets as CSV
                        app.set('trust proxy', ['loopback', 'linklocal', 'uniquelocal']) // specify multiple subnets as an array
                       
                      When specified, the IP addresses or the subnets are excluded from the address determination process, 
                      and the untrusted IP address nearest to the application server is determined as the client’s IP address. 
                      This works by checking if req.socket.remoteAddress is trusted. If so, then each address in X-Forwarded-For 
                      is checked from right to left until the first non-trusted address.                  

Number                Use the address that is at most n number of hops away from the Express application. req.socket.remoteAddress 
                      is the first hop, and the rest are looked for in the X-Forwarded-For header from right to left. A value of 0 
                      means that the first untrusted address would be req.socket.remoteAddress, i.e. there is no reverse proxy.   

                        When using this setting, it is important to ensure there are not multiple, different-length paths to 
                        the Express application such that the client can be less than the configured number of hops away, 
                        otherwise it may be possible for the client to provide any value.  

Function              Custom trust implementation.

                        app.set('trust proxy', (ip) => {
                          if (ip === '127.0.0.1' || ip === '123.123.123.123') return true // trusted IPs
                          else return false
                        })

Enabling trust proxy will have the following impact:

  * The value of req.hostname is derived from the value set in the X-Forwarded-Host header, 
    which can be set by the client or by the proxy.

  * X-Forwarded-Proto can be set by the reverse proxy to tell the app whether it is https 
    or http or even an invalid name. This value is reflected by req.protocol.

  * The req.ip and req.ips values are populated based on the socket address and X-Forwarded-For header, 
    starting at the first untrusted address.
