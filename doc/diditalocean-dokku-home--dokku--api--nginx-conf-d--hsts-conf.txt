# Strict-Transport-Security
# 
# The HTTP Strict-Transport-Security response header (often abbreviated as HSTS) informs browsers that the site 
# should only be accessed using HTTPS, and that any future attempts to access it using HTTP should automatically 
# be converted to HTTPS.
#
# max-age=<expire-time>
#   The time, in seconds, that the browser should remember that a site is only to be accessed using HTTPS.
#
# includeSubDomains Optional
#   If this optional parameter is specified, this rule applies to all of the site's subdomains as well.
